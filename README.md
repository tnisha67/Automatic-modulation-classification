# Automatic-modulation-classification
# Abstract
Neural networks have received a lot of attention in the recent years due to its superior performance in classifying data with
complex structure. In this paper, the feasibility and effectiveness of applying deep learning algorithms for automatic recognition of
modulation type of the received signals is investigated. The test results show that statistical features extracted from input signal data
significantly improve the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Nonetheless, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have proven to achieve performance that outperforms the expert-based approaches. Moreover, in order to reduce the training
time, principal component analysis (PCA) method is applied to decrease the dimension of the training data set. Finally, the
relationship between reducing the dimension of training data set and loss in classification accuracy is investigated by identifying
the representative SNR values for both ANN and CNN architectures.
